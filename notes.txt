establish the npm packages, using npm init(json.package)
then we install express


we installed nodemon as a dev dependecy, so that we dont have to keep running it and restarting
the server


we want to send some data via post, we send it through the body,

to become full stack, you need to know about databases
DBMS(database management system)

Database systems can run on a file system or across multiple nodes or clusters

There are different types of databases:
mysql uses tables and columns
mongodb collections and documents

so the structure differs across databases


mongoDB is a no sql/document database, it means, doesnt use sql to query data
so its different to mysql and postgres


very popular in js world(mern, mean, mevin stack)
meaning - mern - mongoDB express react node js
        - mean - mongoDB express angular node js

Compass - desktop tool to manage database

mongoose - Node.js package for working with mongoDB

In express you can declare a folder to be static called public, in which you can put html and css files in, and thats what will be loaded

whilst developing, we will use webpack dev server, which runs on localhost:3000
and the api runs on 5000

but once you are ready to deploy and do npm run build, the production files go into public and the public static folder will be loaded onto 5000 alongside the API
